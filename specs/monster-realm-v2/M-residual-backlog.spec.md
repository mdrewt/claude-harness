# M-residual-backlog — the standing drain for deferred acceptance criteria

**Status: standing (never "closed").** Created 2026-08-22 by `lp-gates`.

## 1. Why this file exists

Measured across the corpus: **58.8% of uniquely-named slices live in a remediation milestone**;
**61%** of a 46-slice classified sample exist because an earlier slice left *declared* work undone;
and **12 of 18** named continuation slice ids (`14r-c-2`, `m20b-2`, `pt-c1b2`, …) **never got a spec
section at all**. The postmortem named the class RF-3, *"records are not queues"*: 130 defer/park
phrases across the ADR corpus, 45 ADRs with a Residuals section, **zero mechanical consumers**, mean
disclosure→remediation latency **13.1 days**.

The failure was never dishonesty — parks were declared, loudly and in writing. They were declared
into prose nothing consumed, and rediscovered weeks later by the most expensive detector available:
a whole new review milestone.

This file is the sink's drain. Every section below was **promoted mechanically** by
`mr-gates residuals promote` from a `DEFER:` line in a slice's acceptance ledger. The criterion text
is verbatim from the spec section it was deferred from, so promotion is a copy, not spec authoring.

## 2. Slices

*(Generated. `mr-gates residuals promote` appends here; `mr-record queue-add` schedules; the section
is closed when its criterion passes a gate in the slice that picks it up.)*

<!-- PROMOTED SECTIONS APPEND BELOW THIS LINE -->

### rb-1 — RW3-08 (verbatim) — THE SLICE SHALL NOT modify Rust source other than `CONTENT_VERSION` an (from rw3b X8, deferred 2026-08-23)
`touches: (inherit from source slice — REVIEW)`
`after:` — · source: rw3b · residual: R-rw3b-X8

Deferred with reason: RW3-08 as written is mechanically unsatisfiable for ANY slice that appends an evolution edge or a derived species. `game-core/tests/eg3_evolution_graph.rs` pinned the edge set EXACTLY (`t2`: `paths.len() == 10`; `t7`: `edge_ids == (1..=10)`) and `game-core/src/content.rs`'s `EG1_TIER_ONE_IDS` pins the derived-species set EXACTLY, so both go RED the instant wave-3 content lands. Both were EXTENDED,

EARS: RW3-08 (verbatim) — THE SLICE SHALL NOT modify Rust source other than `CONTENT_VERSION` and its own new test files, and SHALL NOT edit `Affinity`, `AbilityEffect`, or `content/type_chart.ron`.
Tests: proof-of-teeth — this criterion's own gate must RED before the fix and pass after (ADR-0010).
## 3. How an entry gets worked

1. A slice cannot meet a seeded gate and writes `DEFER: <gate> -> backlog — <reason>`.
2. `mr-gates verify` (supervisor, pre-merge) emits an append-only row into `mr-residuals.jsonl`
   with `status: unpromoted`.
3. At Pick-work the supervisor **promotes** it: a `### <id>` section is appended here from the
   criterion's verbatim EARS text, and `mr-record queue-add` puts it on the fast path.
4. **Aging decides priority, not a fixed rank.** Past `t1_promote_days` a residual outranks new
   PLAN §9 work; past `t2_stale_days` it outranks everything below CI-red and WIP. Debt-first
   starves features and features-first starves debt; aging is self-balancing, because preempting
   clears the debt and normal order resumes. Constants live once, in `mr-gates`
   (`mr-gates residuals policy --json`); `mr-selfcheck` reads them from there rather than
   restating them — lp-11b's defect was two copies of one constant in two files.
5. The promoted slice's own ledger re-seeds the same criterion as a gate. **It is closed only when
   the promoted slice's own ledger is fully resolved** — `mr-gates residuals close` refuses on a
   missing ledger or any unmet gate, and `--force` is recorded on the row. Closing on "something
   merged with the right branch name" would let a residual be retired by a slice that did not
   deliver it.

## 4. Anti-rot

`mr-selfcheck` fails on `residual-unpromoted` (promote stalled past T1), `residual-stale` (open past
T2) and `residual-graveyard` (rows exist, the oldest is past the window, and none has ever
closed — a MATURITY test, so it stays quiet on day 0 and does NOT go silent once rows age out). The last is
the direct falsification test for this whole mechanism, and it is not hypothetical: **`mr-feedback`
holds 189 rows of which 0 ever reached a terminal state**, which is why `lp-15` retires it. A sink
without a drain is a graveyard with better lighting.

## 5. Explicitly NOT in scope

- **Seeding the 329 pre-existing OUTSTANDING items.** That stays `lp-registry`'s, with its own
  disposition-on-day-one requirement; bulk-seeding them here would rebuild the graveyard inside the
  new mechanism and make the alarms fire hundreds of times on their first run.
- **Being a general backlog.** Only deferred *acceptance criteria* land here. Feature ideas, feedback
  and operator decisions have their own channels.
